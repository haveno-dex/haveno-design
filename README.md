# Haveno Design

Meta repository for design discussions and development. Feel free to open issues.

Design development is divided into two efforts: 'v1' and 'ongoing'. 'v1' is the design being built by the frontend team for the [user interface](https://github.com/haveno-dex/haveno-ui/) and it will receive non-breaking improvements. The 'ongoing' design is the continuous effort of making the design optimal, regardless of implementation.
